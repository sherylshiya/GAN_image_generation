HELLO THERE🙋🏻‍♀️.
so basically this project aims to generate real look a like fake images using the custom generator and discriminator
working on building a laten space that tires to mimic the distribution of the original data distribution.
so here i have used a sample of low number of training data instances as of the limited resource constraint nd trained for less than a 200 epoch 
i have used real airplane images for generation .(hav given in the folder for usage)
